----------------------------------------
    1.  Description
----------------------------------------

    muzz is a program that will calculate a projectile's energy given its
    mass and velocity (or the reverse).  It'll also do the whole 'Taylor
    Knockout Formula' thing, if you're into that for some reason.



----------------------------------------
    2.  Installation / Uninstallation
----------------------------------------

    To install, compile the program with 'make'.  It shouldn't take long, though
    obviously you'll need a C compiler.  If you're on any modern UNIX or Linux
    distro you should already have one, and if you don't, shame on you.  Go
    install GCC from your distro's package manager (or gcc.gnu.org) right away.

    It links to the std math library, which you should already have.

    After you've compiled the program, install it to your system by issuing
    'make install' with superuser privileges.

    To remove the program and all its accessories, return to the directory to
    which you originally extracted the tarball (or whichever directory has the
    Makefile for this program) and type 'make uninstall', again with superuser
    privileges.

    3.  Usage
----------------------------------------

Usage:  muzz [OPTION] MASS VELOCITY [DIAMETER]

Options
  -h		Print this help text
  -H		Print additional information on units used, etc.
  -E		Print example usage
  -V		Print version and author info
  -S or q	Silent (quiet) mode; print only the resultant number
  -s		Use Si (metric) units of measure - grams, m/s, joules
  -i		Use Imperial units - grains, ft/s, lbf (default)
  -m		Calculate for mass (num1 = velocity, num2 = energy)
  -v		Calculate for velocity (num1 = mass, num2 = energy)
  -e		Calculate for energy (num1 = mass, num2 = velocity) (default)
  -K		Use industry standard imperial constant (450,240)  (default)
  -k [num]	Custom user constant
  -c		Calculate constant using 'industry' GAC-1
  -C		Calculate constant using standard GAC-2
  -p		Be precise (do not round any numbers)
  -t		Use Taylor Knockout Formula (give mass, velocity, diameter)


----------------------------------------
    4.  Examples
----------------------------------------

muzz 230 900
  Returns muzzle energy of a 230 grain bullet @ 900 ft/s

muzz -s 15 270
  Using Si units of measure, returns joules (15grams @ 270 m/s)

muzz -qp 230 900
  Same, but only the number and with nothing rounded

muzz -mq 900 414
  Given the velocity and muzzle energy, it will return only the mass
  of the projectile.

muzz -t 230 860 .45
  Prints result using Taylor Knockout Formula, with the params being
  the mass (grains), velocity (ft/s) and diameter

muzz -ts 15 255 11.6
  Same, but using Si units (grams, meters/second, mm)
